Setup
At first all depending libraries must be installed. To make sure it works you should create a virtual environment for the installed dependencies.
Open a terminal in the folder of the cloned repository.

Then use these commands:
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate (to exit just type deactivate)
windows: venv\scripts\activate.bat (to exit use the venv\scripts\deactivate.bat)
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

All dependencies will then be installed.

For the vehicle detection you will need data from the kitti dataset, see ./image_processing/kitti_data/README

For saving videos in linux you will need ffmpeg:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mc3man/trusty-media
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade   # recommended on first use
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
